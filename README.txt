Exercise Project Explanation:

For this exercise,
1. I created a new project using Maven and Java.
2. I created a CUCUMBER BDD framework from scratch for this exercise to prevent any issues such as compatibility, missing dependencies etc.    
3. In this project, I used Selenium, Cucumber,and Junit for assertions.
4. I created one test scenario in a feature file located at src/test/resources/Features.
4. To trigger the automation, I created the CucumberRunner class in the runners package. Please find the CucumberRunner class inside  runners package and run the class to start test execution.
5. Please also go to the "FindFakeGoldPage" located at src/test/java/com/automation/pages/FindFakeGoldPage.java to see the code implementations for the automation.   

How to run the test:
	Please run the CucumberRunner class located at src/test/java/com/automation/runners/CucumberRunner.java
